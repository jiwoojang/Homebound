A cute little RV road trip game made for Global Game Jam 2019

Ride into the never ending sunset, collect fuel along the way to keep your journey going. Along the way you feel free to collect some souvenirs to remember your journey by when it inevitably comes to an end.

Made with Unity 3D

*Completed with the gracious help of Dean Elliott, Greg Wong, Tony Le, and Armon Sohalian*
